# RivenHydra
This project was once destined to be a Discord bot called the "RivenHydra". It was supposed to automatically analyze Rivens and their prices with the help of OCR, feed them into a neural network and then analyze this data in order to figure out prices easily.
This worked so badly, I eventually gave up on the whole project. Everything is like 20% done, but feel free to do with this as you please.
